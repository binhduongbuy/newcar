title: Preparation to GDPR
---
We’re committed to partnering with our Customers and Users to help them understand and prepare for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is a very comprehensive EU data privacy law which will go into effect on May 25, 2018.

Besides strengthening and standardizing user data privacy across the EU nations, it will require new or additional obligations on all organizations that handle EU citizens’ personal data, regardless of where the organizations themselves are located.
